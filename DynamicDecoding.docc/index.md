# Dynamic Decoding for Deeply‑Nested JSON

Welcome to the documentation for **Dynamic Decoding** — a lightweight approach to extracting values buried deep inside JSON without defining the whole model tree.

This catalog complements a runnable **playground** demo. Use the playground for live examples; use these pages to learn concepts, API usage, and best practices.

@Intro(title: "What you'll learn")
- Decode a value directly at a deep JSON path using `JSONDecoder`
- Decode a model from a sub‑tree
- Understand error messages and when to prefer full models
